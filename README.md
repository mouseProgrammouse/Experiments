# Experiments
 ðŸš€ This repository is a simple playground for experimenting with basic data structures in JavaScript, including:
    Linked List (linkedList.js)
    Queue (queue.js)

## How to Run
Clone or download the repository.
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

From the command line, run:
```sh
node linkedList.js
node queue.js
node doublyLinkedList.js
node stack.js 0 # for array implementation
node stack.js 1 # for linked list implementation
node circularLinkedList.js
# Sortings:
node quickSort.js
```

Youâ€™ll see console output showing the basic operations (like adding, removing, and printing) in action.
